    The exploration of the deep-sea is a field that has widely developed both technology and knowledge through the vast array of challenges that the oceans colossal pressure and temperature provides. Unlike the heavy 
    pressure resistant robots manufactured by humans, deep-sea organisms thrive in these extremes, demonstrating an array of survival adaptations and techniques that scientists have been inspired to develop as their 
    own. This perspective communicates the history of ocean exploring vessels and how the use of soft mechanisms has been developed to create a superior method of deep-sea exploration.

    The world's oceans present a vast and resource rich environment, this as well as the huge area of ocean that remains unexplored, 95% <a href="#(NOAA, 2024)"><I>(NOAA, 2024)</I></a>, creates an alluring field where both technology and knowledge can be 
    developed. This, however, due to the extreme pressures produced by the different depths of the oceans, has required the development of technology such as unmanned vessels and pressure resistant hulls <a href="#( Weicheng, c. et al. (2023))"><I>( Weicheng, c.
    et al. (2023))</I></a>. These developments, however, were also accompanied by a range of limitations such as increased weight and reduced adaptability, this led to the further development of technology to produce soft bodied
    mechanisms. Contrary to previous technology these soft robots enable delicate interactions with different specimens and provide a superior level of adaptability, <a href="#(Guorui, L. Et al. (2023))"><I>(Guorui, L. Et al. (2023)).</I></a>

      <pre id="History_InText">
    Originally deep-sea exploration was conducted by submersibles, these vehicles were designed to be manned by a small number of passengers and often had to be connected to a ship via a fiber optic cable which transferred
    the array of data that was collected. This technology, whilst effective during the emergence of deep-sea exploration, soon became ineffective with the invention of ROVS (Remotely operated Vehicles). ROVS removed the 
    time limitations created by the human passengers and decreased the risk of human harm, allowing vehicles to reach deeper and more remote areas. <a href="#(Marranzino, 2017)"><I>(Marranzino, 2017)</I></a>. However, due to the use of the fiber optic 
    umbilical cord that attached to these types of machines transmitting data to a ship, maneuverability and adaptability was reduced. This led to the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVS) which are highly 
    maneuverable, self-propelled and must be mapped to a specific path using code. AUVS are also used cooperatively with other vehicles to create a large system for exploration that is more cost effective and efficient. 
    <a href="#( Weicheng, c. et al. (2023))"><I>( Weicheng, c. et al. (2023))</I></a>.

    To ensure these vehicles can survive the extreme pressures of the ocean the material had to also be developed, creating a material that is strong and durable whilst also ensuring the vehicle is light weight was a 
    necessity in the production of these vehicles as it ensures they are maneuverable and can effectively function when acted upon by higher pressures. The use of light composite materials combined with a type of high 
    strength metal such as steel or aluminum is currently a popular solution for creating a pressure resistant hull. Materials such as stainless steel and Aluminum are used over an array of other materials due to their 
    strength but also because the corrosion rate of these materials decreases with the depth, ensuring these materials are highly durable. This reaction occurs due to the decrease in both temperature level and oxygen. 
    <a href="#(Chen, s. et, al. (2021))"><I>(chen, s. et, al. (2021))</I></a> This, however, also had its faults as composite materials vary in quality during construction and are also very expensive to produce. The use of pressure resistant hulls as well 
    as being expensive, greatly reduces maneuverability and hence adaptability of underwater vehicles. <a href="#( Weicheng, c. et al. (2023))"><I>( Weicheng, c. et al. (2023))</I></a>. These pressure resistant designs also include risks such as structural failure. 
    This risk was demonstrated through the incident involving the Nereus HROV where the vessel imploded at a depth of 9900m.  <a href="#(Guorui, L. Et al. (2023))"><I>(Guorui, L. Et al. (2023)).</I></a>

    Consequently, scientists adopted the research of deep-sea organisms for inspiration. The deep-sea environment provides a range of abilities and survival characteristics, such as pressure resilience and mobility (Guorui, L.
    Et al. (2023)), that scientists could study and experiment with, exploring the extreme mechanical adaptations that these organisms provided. (Feng, J-C. et al, (2022)). Primarily the collection of deep-sea samples to study
    was extremely challenging. Most deep-sea organisms consisted of a gelatinous type of structure with tissue of extremely low stiffness. This created a challenge as previous methods of obtaining these samples such as nets or
    vacuum devices often damaged the sample. (Sinatra N et al, 2019). This influenced the development of a soft gripper that has control over the force it applies and can also manipulate their shape depending on the geometry of
    the object it is handling. An example of this type of mechanism for the use of deep-sea research was the Fin Ray effect soft gripper, inspired by the design of a fish’s fin. These grippers are soft and triangular and use
    buckling cross beams to conform around an object as shown in figure 1. (Yao, J. et al. (2024)).

    With these soft grippers researchers now had access to a wider range of organisms such as deep sea invertebrates. These invertebrates utilize hydrostatic skeletons, which consists of a fluid filled cavity surrounded by muscle.
    These muscles act against the pressure of the fluid to generate movement, or muscular hydrostats which consists of a structure of highly dense muscles which provide skeletal support to the organism. Examples of these organisms
    are snailfish or octopuses, these provided the inspiration for the development of mechanics such as muscle like actuators, these created a soft mechanism with movement that could withstand high pressures, or hydraulic jamming
    grippers which provide a greater force allowing these mechanisms to interact with larger or heavier objects. Further examples of soft bodied mechanisms are shown in Figure 2 and 3 below. (Guorui, L. Et al. (2023)).

    In conclusion the development of soft bodied mechanisms has revolutionized deep-sea exploration due to the increase in adaptability of these mechanisms. The use of these mechanics allows a submersible to reach and progress
    effectively within extreme pressure depths. As well as this the advancement in soft gripper technology created a new field of discovery that previously had been impossible. Whilst still being in the early stages of development,
    soft bodied mechanisms create a massive potential for the future of deep-sea exploration.
